# Task #6 Implementation Summary

## Extended Task Models and Services for AI Integration

### 1. Updated Models (`backend/app/models.py`)
- Added `TaskSource` enum with values: `MANUAL` and `AI_GENERATED`
- Extended `TaskCreate` model with optional AI fields:
  - `source`: Defaults to `MANUAL`
  - `source_image_id`: Optional UUID reference to source image
  - `ai_confidence`: Optional float (0.0-1.0) with validation
  - `ai_provider`: Optional string for AI provider name
- Extended `Task` response model with the same AI fields
- Created `AITaskCreate` model that requires all AI fields and enforces `source=AI_GENERATED`

### 2. Task Service (`backend/app/services/task_service.py`)
- Created `TaskService` class with:
  - `determine_priority_from_confidence()`: Maps AI confidence to task priority
    - >= 0.8: High priority
    - >= 0.6: Medium priority
    - < 0.6: Low priority
  - `create_ai_tasks()`: Batch creation of AI tasks with automatic prioritization
  - `create_single_ai_task()`: Convenience method for single task creation

### 3. Updated Task Routes (`backend/app/tasks.py`)
- Modified imports to include new models and enums
- Updated `create_task()` to handle enum conversion for database storage
- Added `/ai-generated` endpoint for creating AI tasks with automatic prioritization
- Added source filtering to the main tasks GET endpoint
- Added `/ai-generated/with-images` endpoint to fetch AI tasks with their source images

### 4. Image Processing Integration (`backend/app/ai/image_processing.py`)
- Added imports for AI task models and service
- Added `create_tasks_from_analysis()` method to convert AI analysis results to tasks
- Integrated with `TaskService` for proper task creation and prioritization

### 5. Test Coverage
- Created unit tests for:
  - Task models validation (`test_task_models.py`)
  - TaskService prioritization logic (`test_task_service.py`)
- Created integration tests for:
  - AI task creation endpoints (`test_tasks_ai_integration.py`)
  - Task filtering by source
  - AI tasks with image relationships

## Key Features Implemented

1. **AI Task Tracking**: All AI-generated tasks are properly marked with their source, confidence score, and provider
2. **Automatic Prioritization**: Tasks are automatically prioritized based on AI confidence unless explicitly overridden
3. **Source Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by source (manual vs AI-generated)
4. **Image Association**: AI tasks maintain reference to their source images for context
5. **Validation**: Proper validation for all AI-related fields including confidence score ranges

## Testing Notes

The implementation includes comprehensive unit and integration tests. While I couldn't run them in this environment, they cover:
- Model validation and defaults
- Priority determination logic
- Task creation with AI fields
- API endpoint behavior
- Integration with existing task functionality

## Next Steps

This implementation is ready to be integrated with the image analysis endpoint (Task #7) which will:
1. Accept image uploads
2. Process them through the AI provider
3. Use the `ImageProcessingService.create_tasks_from_analysis()` method
4. Return created tasks to the user
