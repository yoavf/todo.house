# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive Hebrew localization for TodoHouse, enabling the application to serve Hebrew-speaking users during the MVP phase. The implementation follows a phased approach that prioritizes quick wins while establishing scalable internationalization (i18n) infrastructure for future languages. The feature includes RTL (Right-to-Left) UI support, Hebrew translations for all user-facing text, and locale-aware AI prompt handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Hebrew-speaking user, I want to view the TodoHouse interface in Hebrew with proper RTL layout, so that I can use the application in my native language with a natural reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application with Hebrew locale THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in Hebrew
2. WHEN Hebrew locale is active THEN the system SHALL apply RTL (Right-to-Left) layout to all interface elements
3. WHEN Hebrew locale is active THEN the system SHALL set the HTML dir attribute to "rtl"
4. WHEN Hebrew locale is active THEN the system SHALL mirror directional UI elements (icons, buttons, navigation)
5. WHEN Hebrew locale is active THEN the system SHALL reverse swipe gestures and interactions appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between English and Hebrew languages seamlessly, so that I can choose my preferred language for using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL detect their preferred locale from Accept-Language header
2. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same URL structure without locale-specific paths
3. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL persist their language preference for future visits (future user setting)
4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page context and user state
5. IF a user has an unsupported locale THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default English locale

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Hebrew-speaking user, I want all task-related text, buttons, and messages to appear in Hebrew, so that I can fully understand and interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL display all task status labels in Hebrew (active, snoozed, completed)
2. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL display all priority levels in Hebrew (low, medium, high)
3. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL display all task type categories in Hebrew (interior, exterior, electricity, plumbing, etc.)
4. WHEN interacting with dialogs THEN the system SHALL display all confirmation messages and buttons in Hebrew
5. WHEN viewing time-related text THEN the system SHALL display relative time phrases in Hebrew (tomorrow, this weekend, next week)
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages in Hebrew

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Hebrew-speaking user, I want AI-generated tasks from image analysis to be contextually appropriate for Hebrew speakers, so that the generated tasks feel natural and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading an image for analysis THEN the system SHALL use Hebrew-aware AI prompts based on user locale
2. WHEN AI generates tasks THEN the system SHALL provide Hebrew examples and context in the prompts
3. WHEN AI analysis fails with Hebrew prompts THEN the system SHALL fallback to English prompts gracefully
4. WHEN using Hebrew prompts THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 95% of the task extraction accuracy compared to English
5. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL track success metrics by locale for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a scalable internationalization infrastructure, so that adding future languages is straightforward and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new translations THEN the system SHALL support type-safe translation keys with TypeScript
2. WHEN loading translations THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size by loading only required locale messages
3. WHEN rendering pages THEN the system SHALL support both static and dynamic rendering with locale detection
4. WHEN adding new locales THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration changes
5. WHEN translations are missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to English gracefully without breaking the UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor localization performance and usage, so that I can optimize the feature and understand user preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with localized features THEN the system SHALL track locale usage metrics
2. WHEN AI processes images with different locales THEN the system SHALL track success rates by language
3. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL monitor translation loading times
4. WHEN users switch locales THEN the system SHALL track language preference patterns
5. WHEN errors occur in localized features THEN the system SHALL log locale-specific error information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on a slow connection, I want Hebrew localization to load quickly without significantly impacting application performance, so that the localized experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading Hebrew locale THEN the system SHALL add no more than 30KB to the bundle size
2. WHEN switching locales THEN the system SHALL load translations in under 50ms
3. WHEN using Hebrew locale THEN the system SHALL maintain the same rendering performance as English
4. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL lazy-load locale-specific resources
5. WHEN caching is available THEN the system SHALL cache translation files for offline access
