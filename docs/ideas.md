# Future Ideas

## User Feedback System for AI-Generated Tasks

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide feedback on generated tasks, so that the system can improve over time.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing generated tasks THEN the user SHALL be able to rate their relevance
2. WHEN providing feedback THEN the user SHALL be able to mark tasks as helpful or not helpful
3. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL store it for analysis
4. WHEN sufficient feedback is collected THEN the system SHALL use it to improve future generations

### Notes
- This could be implemented as a future enhancement once the core functionality is stable
- Would require additional database schema for feedback storage
- Could integrate with machine learning pipelines for continuous improvement
