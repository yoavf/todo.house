# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload or capture images of home maintenance scenarios and automatically generate relevant maintenance tasks using AI image analysis. The system will analyze uploaded images to identify maintenance needs and create prioritized task lists, starting with common scenarios like bathroom fixtures, lawn care, and appliance maintenance. This represents the foundation for multiple AI-powered features, requiring a flexible architecture that supports different AI providers and rapid prompt iteration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a homeowner, I want to upload a photo of an area in my home, so that I can automatically receive relevant maintenance tasks based on what the AI sees in the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file size is within acceptable limits (max 10MB)
3. WHEN a valid image is processed THEN the system SHALL return one or more maintenance tasks with descriptions
4. WHEN tasks are generated THEN the system SHALL order them by priority level
5. IF the image cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to capture a photo directly from my device camera, so that I can quickly generate tasks without needing to save photos first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the feature on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a camera capture option
2. WHEN the camera option is selected THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions appropriately
3. WHEN a photo is captured THEN the system SHALL process it the same as uploaded images
4. IF camera access is denied THEN the system SHALL fallback to file upload option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI provider to be configurable, so that we can experiment with different models and switch providers without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes images THEN it SHALL use a configurable AI provider interface
2. WHEN switching AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain the same input/output contract
3. WHEN adding new providers THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes
4. WHEN provider configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes without restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily test and iterate on AI prompts, so that I can quickly improve task generation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing prompts THEN the system SHALL provide a testing interface for rapid iteration
2. WHEN testing prompts THEN the system SHALL log both input images and generated outputs
3. WHEN prompt changes are made THEN the system SHALL allow testing without full deployment
4. WHEN evaluating results THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on generation quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated tasks to be automatically added to my task list, so that I can manage them alongside my other tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are generated from an image THEN the system SHALL create them in the user's task list
2. WHEN tasks are created THEN they SHALL include the source image as context
3. WHEN tasks are created THEN they SHALL be marked with appropriate categories (e.g., "AI Generated")
4. WHEN viewing generated tasks THEN the user SHALL be able to see the original image that created them

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor AI usage and costs, so that I can manage resource consumption effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log usage metrics
2. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL track API calls, tokens used, and costs
3. WHEN usage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide warnings
4. IF usage limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle rate limiting
