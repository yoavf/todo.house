            IMPORTANT: This project is in MVP Development Phase. Please review accordingly.

            FIRST: Check /docs/todos.md to see what technical debt is already tracked. Don't suggest items that are already documented there.

            Please review this PR with MVP priorities in mind:

            1. CRITICAL ISSUES (must fix):
               - Bugs that break functionality
               - Security vulnerabilities (unless obvious choice are made for testing and documented in the code)
               - Data loss risks

            2. RECOMMENDATIONS (output as checklist for /docs/todos.md):
               - Code quality improvements (NOT already in /docs/todos.md)
               - Performance optimizations (NOT already in /docs/todos.md)
               - Better error handling (NOT already in /docs/todos.md)
               - Test coverage gaps (NOT already in /docs/todos.md)
               - Architecture improvements (NOT already in /docs/todos.md)

            Before suggesting any improvement:
            1. Read /docs/todos.md
            2. Check if the improvement is already listed
            3. Only suggest NEW items not already tracked

            Format non-critical feedback as:
            ```markdown
            ## Recommendations for /docs/todos.md
            - [ ] [P1] Specific improvement with context
            - [ ] [P2] Nice-to-have enhancement
            ```

            Use priority levels: [P0]=critical, [P1]=important, [P2]=nice-to-have

            Focus on teaching Python best practices where relevant.
